  Answer the following questions.

Questions to Answer.
● How do the world population estimates compare to the provided dataset populations?
● How does the urban population share compare to the rural population?
● What is the tendency and spread of the different water access features?
● How do these measures of water access compare across different types of areas?
● What does the national access to water look like based on national population size?
● What does the urban access to water look like based on urban population size?
● What does rural access look like?
● How do national population size and urbanization affect GNI and water access?

Data Definition: There is a total of 16 features represented in the columns of the dataset

pop_n - The National population size is estimated in thousands.
wat_limit_n - The estimated national share of people with limited services (%).
name - The country or area name.
pop_u - The urban population share estimate in percentage points (%).
wat_unimp_n - The estimated national share of people with unimproved service (%).
income_group - The country's classification according to income group.
wat_bas_n - The estimated national share of people with at least basic service (%).
wat_sur_n - The estimated national share of people with surface service (%).
wat_bas_r - The estimated rural share with at least basic service (%)
wat_sur_r - The estimated rural share of people with surface service (%)
wat_unimp_u - The estimated urban share of people with unimproved services (%)
wat_lim_r  - The estimated rural share of people with limited services (%)
wat_bas_u - The estimated urban share of people with basic services (%)
wat_sur_u - The estimated urban share of people with surface services (%)
wat_unimp_r - The estimated rural share of people with unimproved services (%)
wat_lim_u - The estimated urban share of people with limited services (%)


Data Analytics Process:
IMPORT and CLEANING
1. Imported dataset to Google Sheets.
2. Fixed the semi-colon-separated column headers by splitting text into columns 
3. Fixed the other five instances of semi-colon-separated values in the cells.

INVESTIGATING POPULATION SIZE
1. Created a new sheet called Global 2020 report
2. On the new sheet, determined the total national population and added the
estimated world population (7.821 billion).
3. On the main sheet, created a new feature(column) called pop_u_val, which is the
urban population value.
4. In Global 2020 report sheet, determined the total urban population and also estimated
urban population which is 55% of the estimated total world population.
5. In addition, Calculated the total urban population from pop_u_val column in the main sheet
6. Calculated the percentage difference between the total population included in the 
dataset and the estimated total population for both the national and urban population
7.Created a line chart to visualize the comparison between national population living
in rural versus urban areas, using a new feature called pop_r which is the rural share of the population in percentage 
using the features pop_u and pop_n.
- The line chart is not very comprehensible due to outliers.
- To increase the readability of our data visualization, changed the unit of the x-axis
- Created a new feature in the original dataset called pop_n (m) which is pop_n rounded 
to the nearest million.
- Change the x-axis to the newly created pop_n (m) and select the aggregate using an average.
- Use smooth lines for our chart and add a point representation of the aggregated
data point.
