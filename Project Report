Solving the water crisis in a fictional country Maji Dogo.

President Naledi has tasked me with finding nuggets of insight that will help the government solve the water crisis in Maji Dogo. After
completing a survey in the country, a database of 60,000 records was created.

The database contains these tables:
  data_dictionary
  employee
  global_water_access
  location
  visits
  water_quality
  water_source
  well_pollution
