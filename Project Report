Solving the water crisis in a fictional country Maji Dogo.

President Naledi has tasked me with finding nuggets of insight that will help the government solve the water crisis in Maji Dogo. After
completing a survey in the country, a database of 60,000 records was created.

The database contains these tables:
  data_dictionary,   employee,   global_water_access,   location,   visits,  water_quality,  water_source,  well_pollution

Some tables contained errors as evident after running some SQL queries as outlined in the SQL code document. The errors were removed as part
of the data cleaning process.
The table affected included the water_pollution table.
