Solving the water crisis in a fictional country Maji Dogo.

President Naledi has tasked me with finding nuggets of insight that will help the government solve the water crisis in Maji Dogo. After
completing a survey in the country, a database of 60,000 records was created.

The database contains these tables:
  data_dictionary,   employee,   global_water_access,   location,   visits,  water_quality,  water_source,  well_pollution

Some tables contained errors as evident after running some SQL queries as outlined in the SQL code document. The errors were removed as part
of the data cleaning process.
The table affected included the water_pollution table.

The delve into the location table clearly shows that there are enough records and that the entire country was covered during the survey exercise.
Our dataset represents the actual situation on the ground. 60% of the water sources are in the rural areas.

According to the global_water_access table, the national population of Maji Ndogo is 27,628,100 people. But the accurate number from the water_source
table is 27,628,140 this shows that our records are have the same information across different tables.
