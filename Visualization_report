PROJECT VISUALIZATION AND DASHBOARD
This is a series of visually engaging reports created using Power BI and compiled here as images. 
These reports aim to present the data in a manner that is not only accessible but also compelling,
ensuring that the key messages resonate with the stakeholders.

In the visuals, we will utilize clean and intuitive designs with a color scheme that conveys 
the water crisis theme. 
There is additional data resulting from pictures taken at the queue and later analyzed using AI and 
Machine learning. The AI identifies the different people in the image, classifies them and then 
counts each type. 

A short explanation of the new data:
•	hour_of_day - The hour of day at the time_of_record. This will help us aggregate by the hour of the day. 
•	day_of_week - The day of the week from the time_of_record. This will help us aggregate by the day of the week.
•	percent_male - The percentage of men in the queue at the time_of_record. 
•	percent_female - The percentage of men in the queue at the time_of_record. 
•	percent_child - The percentage of men in the queue at the time_of_record.

After SQL exploration, These insights were extracted:
1. Most water sources are rural in Maji Ndogo
2. 43% of the people are using shared taps. 2000 people often share one tap.
3. 31% of the population has water infrastructure in their homes but within that group
    45% face non-functional systems due to issues with pipes, pumps, and reservoirs. Towns 
    like Amina, the rural parts of Amanzi, and a couple of towns across Akatsi and Hawassa have broken 
    infrastructure.
4. 18% of the people are using wells, but within that, only 28% are clean. These are mostly
    in Hawassa, Kilimani and Akatsi.
6. The citizens often face long wait times for water, averaging more than 120 minutes.
    - Queues are longer on Saturdays
    - Queues are longer in the mornings and evenings
    - Wednesdays and Sundays have the shortest queues.

The first visual will show insights into:
    1. Rural vs. Urban population
    2. 43% of the population using shared taps
    3. 31% of the population having water infrastructure in their homes
    4. 18% of the people using wells.
